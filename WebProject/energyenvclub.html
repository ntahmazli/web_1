                                    <p> Open any media- TV, radio, social media. What are you going to see? Forests on fire, cities in flood, melting ice in poles, plastic bag in Mariana trench, so on and so forth. We are destroying the world to exist, yet we cease to exist together with it. It is an undeniable fact that huge steps should be taken to solve the issue. Nonetheless, if every single individual, or family, or community tries to make an effort with at least small steps, there is hope, and there is a future. Our objective is to be the authors of those steps at ADA University. However, we will not be only confined to the boundaries of our universities. We will do our best to not leaves those promises, which we made to nature, merely on words, but implement them and bring fresh and unexplored ideas to the table. One of our first goals is to inform younger generations about the significance of the global problem since people need to perceive the factual danger from the very beginning- early ages of their life. Schools, most probably, will be the initial destinations in the implementation procedure - ADA school can be the very first too. We believe that if we care about the problem, we need to start from the inside before jumping right off outside. There will be no boring lectures, or advice “You should do that, or we all die”. We will attempt to suggest the best and most practical ways as we can and be pragmatic about the solutions. Interesting, interactional and brainstorming involving aspects will also be considered to make people not only more aware of the problem but make them start acting right after realizing the potential scenarios. Furthermore, we will try to contact and involve different organizations not only in Baku but also in our country and even in the world.</p>
